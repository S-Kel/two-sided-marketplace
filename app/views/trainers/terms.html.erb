However you acknowledge that if your request is urgent then we may recommend you a coach who has not yet obtained or is in the process of confirming their WWCC Number. In such instances it is your responsibility to confirm that the coach you employee has a registered WWCC Number. In addition you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to check the currency of the WWCC</p><p>Number for coaches that employed by you on a recurring basis.</p><p>(iii) Provide you with the contact details of the coaches that you decide to accept so that you may contact them to meet prior to having them join.</p><p>(iv) Maintain firm contact with you and the coaches to ensure a functional working relationship that sees both parties happy.</p><p>(c) You acknowledge that you will be using us as a recruitment service to find coaches for you.

This can be done via an induction day run by the school.</p><p>(d) Give us adequate time to be able to meet all the requests of the school. Though our employees work as quickly as possible, the longer the period given by you to find the necessary coaches the higher the chances of those requests being fulfilled.</p><p>(e) Pay us upon the first request of a coaching position that needs to be filled (unless we have agreed to provide you with a free trial). Payment terms are 30 days from making the request. Late payments will receive a reminder invoice with a payment term of 14 days.

If you do not inform us then we have the right to charge for the services of finding that coach.</p><p>(i) If we recommend a coach to you and the coach decides not to commit to your program due to reasons that are controllable by you (for example the pay rate does not suffice for that coach, or a change is made to the previously notified training times that no longer suit the coach) then you will be charged.</p><p>11. Refunds policy for schools, organisations and sporting associations</p><p>This clause 11 applies if you are a school, organisation or sporting association.</p><p>(a) We take pride in being able to service the needs of schools, organisations and sporting associations as best as possible.

In the event of this happening we would not charge you unless some prior arrangement has been agreed upon.</p><p>(b) If you do not inform us that a coach was unable to be locked in due to time constraints or other reasons that were not known by us at the time of recommendation, then we retain the right to charge you for finding that coach unless you inform us before being billed that no employment was secured in respect of that coach.</p><p><strong>Terms and Conditions for private clients e.g. not a school or association</strong></p><p>12.
